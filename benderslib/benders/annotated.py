class AnnotatedBenders(BendersSolver):
    """The class to perform Benders decomposition using annotation-based approach.

    This class decomposes the original problem into a master problem and a subproblem
    based on the specified complicating/master variables, and then applies the chosen Benders
    decomposition method to solve the problem.

    .. admonition:: Master problem variables vs. complicating variables
        :class: note

        The **master problem variables** are variables that appears only in the master problem.
        It has a subset, **complicating variables**, which are variables that are passed to the subproblem
        as known parameters.
        Though they are *sometimes identical*, the decomposition is based on the former.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original_problem:
        The original optimization problem in a solver-specific format.
    solver: Type[SolverBase]
        The solver class to be used for solving the master and subproblems, e.g., :class:`~.solvers.Gurobi`.
        It should be compatible with the :attr:`original_problem`.
    complicating_vars: list[str]
        A list of variable names that are considered complicating variables for the decomposition.
        The complicating variables are those that are passed to the subproblem as known parameters.
    master_vars: list[str], optional
        A list of variable names to be included in the master problem.
        The master variables are used to define the master problem and subproblem from the original problem.
        It is usually a superset of ``complicating_vars``.
        If not provided, it defaults to ``complicating_vars``.
    benders: Type[BendersSolver], optional
        The Benders decomposition method to be applied, e.g., :class:`ClassicalBenders`.
        If not provided, the class :class:`BendersSolver` will be used with the optimality
        and feasibility cut generators provided.
        If provided, parameters ``optimality_cut`` and ``feasibility_cut`` will be ignored,
        and the default cut generators of the chosen Benders method will be used.
    optimality_cut: Type[CutGenerator], optional
        The optimality cut generator to be used in the Benders decomposition.
        If not provided, the default optimality cut generator of the chosen Benders method ``benders`` will be used.
    feasibility_cut: Type[CutGenerator], optional
        The feasibility cut generator to be used in the Benders decomposition.
        If not provided, the default feasibility cut generator of the chosen Benders method ``benders`` will be used.
    params: BendersParams, optional
        An instance of :class:`BendersParams` containing parameters for the Benders decomposition process.
        If not provided, default parameters will be used.

    Caution
    -------
    - The ``solver`` should be a **class** (not an instance) that inherits from :class:`SolverBase`.
    - The ``benders`` should be a **class** (not an instance) that inherits from :class:`BendersSolver`.
    - The ``optimality_cut`` and ``feasibility_cut``, if provided, should be **classes** (not instances)
      that inherit from :class:`CutGenerator`.
