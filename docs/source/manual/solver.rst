Supported Solvers
-------------------------------------------

.. attention::

   BendersLib will **NOT** install any solver to your environment automatically.
   You need to :ref:`install the solvers <solver-installation-table>` separately based on your needs.

BendersLib supports the following solvers.
The features listed in the table are essential for Benders decomposition.
A Benders decomposition variant usually require one or two features to work properly.

* **Dual**:
  The solver can provide dual values of constraints. This is essential for generating *classical optimality cuts*.
  This feature can be required by :doc:`../tutorials/classical` and :doc:`../tutorials/lshaped` implemented
  with :class:`ClassicalBenders` and :class:`LShaped`, respectively, if the user wants to add optimality cuts.
* **Farkas**:
  The solver can provide a Farkas certificate of infeasibility (an extreme ray of the dual).
  This is used to generate *classical feasibility cuts*.
  This feature can be required by :doc:`../tutorials/classical` and :doc:`../tutorials/lshaped` implemented
  with :class:`ClassicalBenders` and :class:`LShaped`, respectively, if the user wants to add feasibility cuts.
* **IIS**:
  The solver can find an Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).
  This helps building stronger *no-good cuts*.
  This feature usually works with :doc:`../tutorials/cbd` and :doc:`../tutorials/lbbd` implemented
  with :class:`CombinatorialBenders` and :class:`LogicBasedBenders`, respectively, if the user wants to add no-good
  feasibility cuts.

These solvers can be categorized into two groups: Mathematical Programming solvers (most of the solvers supported)
and Constraint Programming solvers (:class:`~.solvers.CplexCP` and :class:`~.solvers.Ortools`),
which are two different paradigms for solving optimization problems.
They have distinct approaches and are suited for different types of problems.
A wise choice between the two can lead to more efficient problem-solving.

   * - **Origin**
     - Operations Research (OR)

   * - **Core Idea**
     - Optimize a specific objective function subject to a set of constraints.
     - Find a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints, without necessarily having an objective function.
   * - **Typical Techniques**
     - Simplex method, interior-point methods.
     - Backtracking, constraint propagation, and local search.
   * - **Best Suited For**
     - Problems with quantitative variables and linear/nonlinear relationships.
     - Problems with combinatorial structures and discrete variables.

There are many successful attempts that **combing both paradigms**.
Specifically in :doc:`../tutorials/cbd` and :doc:`../tutorials/lbbd`,
master problems are often modeled using Mathematical Programming,
while subproblems can be modeled using Constraint Programming to leverage its strengths in handling combinatorial constraints.

**Using a solver not listed here? No worries!**
See the next section on how to create a custom solver interface,
and see :ref:`Custom Subproblem <manual_custom_sub>` for even simpler ways to use custom solvers for subproblems.

Customization
-------------------------------------------

BendersLib is designed to be extensible, allowing you to integrate solvers that are not natively supported.
This is achieved by creating a custom solver interface.

To add a new solver, you need to create a class that inherits from :class:`SolverBase`
(for Mathematical Programming, or :class:`SolverCPBase` for Constraint Programming).
This base class serves as a template for all solver interfaces in BendersLib.
The :class:`SolverBase` is an `Abstract Base Class (ABC) <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`_,
a feature from Python.
ABCs are used to define interfaces,
meaning a concrete class that inherits from an ABC must implement all of its
`abstract methods <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod>`_.
This ensures that every solver interface in BendersLib provides a consistent set of functionalities.
When you create your custom solver class,
you must inherit from :class:`SolverBase` and provide implementations for all methods decorated with ``@abstractmethod``,
and define all attributes defined in :class:`SolverBase`.

While :class:`SolverBase` defines several abstract methods that you must implement,
two methods, :meth:`~SolverBase.make_master_problem` and :meth:`~SolverBase.make_sub_problem`,
have special considerations.
These methods are essential for the :class:`AnnotationBenders` class,
which automates the decomposition process.
If you do not intend to use :class:`AnnotationBenders`,
you might not need to implement the full logic for these methods.
However, for a solver interface to be considered for contribution to the official BendersLib repository,
a complete and functional implementation of these methods is required to ensure full compatibility with all library features.

To see a practical implementation, you can refer to the source code of the built-in solver interfaces,
such as :class:`~.solvers.Gurobi`.
Examining how it inherits from :class:`SolverBase` and implements the required methods will provide a clear
and effective template for creating your own custom solver.

**Contributing solver interfaces to BendersLib is welcome!**
See :doc:`contribution` for how to contribute your custom solver interface to the official repository.

Attributes & Methods
-------------------------------------------

Below are the attributes and methods of the base solver interfaces :class:`SolverBase` (Mathematical Programming)
and :class:`SolverCPBase` (Constraint Programming).
Any built-in solver interface is inherited from one of them, with the attributes and methods properly implemented.
Adding a new solver interface requires implementing these attributes and methods,
especially the `abstract methods <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod>`_.
See :class:`SolverBase`  nd :class:`SolverCPBase` for the comprehensive API reference,
and :doc:`built-in solver interfaces <../api/solver>` for examples.
Note that the solver interfaces are not designed to be used directly by end-users.
Use :class:`MasterProblem` and :class:`SubProblem` instead,
which internally utilize the solver interfaces to interact with the optimization solvers.
